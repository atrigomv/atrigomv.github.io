In addition to hacking challenges or other cybersecurity stuff, I enjoy a lot hardening new developments. As a Head of in New Initiatives in MAPFRE one of my main task is securize the software development in the company, both waterfall or Agile projects. So, one of the concepts which as a security member we have to know, is DevOps (or DevSecOps for us). There are a lot of definition of that term, but for me is securize the pipeline of developers and to offer to them cybersecurity services that they can use to improve the security of their projects.
