title: Vulnhub Toppo1
---
It has been a very long time since I've written the last post. This has been due to a hard first middle of year, but I hope it could fix in the next one. Anyway, now I'm on vacation so I have more free time to enjoy with my "cyber-hobby" so I decided to do another vulnhub machine as practice, in this case [Toppo1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/toppo-1,245/) (really easy). Furthermore, in this case I took the opportunity to use this assessment to do my "pentest" practice of a security certification which I'm currently studying, [CHEE](https://thesecuritysentinel.es/curso/certificado-profesional-de-hacking-etico-experto/) of Security Sentinel.

### Information Gathering Step

For the information gathering step, I've used my Kali script [finger.sh](https://github.com/atrigomv/general/blob/master/finger.sh) which scans the most important ports on the target machine and executes additional tools if detects any of them opened. In the case of Toppo1, I detected a CMS application running on 80/tcp port and SSH administrative service running on 22/tcp:
