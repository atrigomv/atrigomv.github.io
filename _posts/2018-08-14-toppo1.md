title: Vulnhub Toppo1
---
It has been a very long time since I've written the last post. This has been due to a hard first middle of year, but I hope it could fix in the next one. Anyway, now I'm on vacation so I have more free time to enjoy with my "cyber-hobby" so I decided to do another vulnhub machine as practice, in this case [Toppo1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/toppo-1,245/) (really easy). Furthermore, in this case I took the opportunity to use this assessment to do my "pentest" practice of a security certification which I'm currently studying, [CHEE](https://thesecuritysentinel.es/curso/certificado-profesional-de-hacking-etico-experto/) of Security Sentinel.
