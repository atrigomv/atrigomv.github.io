title: Malware Analysis SAT_Documento778288
---

Today I want to post a real malware analysis which I've done in my actual company. A project manager contacted with me and sent me a suspicious email which seems to be a tipical phising attack. For people who doesn't speak spanish, the body of the email blame us of tax evasion:

In the email, the sender appended a doc file attachment with the name "SAT_Documento778288.doc". At first glance, VirusTotal report to us a Macro-based malware, probably written in VBA (Visual Basic for Application). It is interesting to observe how any of the most important AV solutions don't detect the malicious code:
