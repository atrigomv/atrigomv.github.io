title: Vulnhub Node 1
---

Happily I´ve had enough time to do another Vulnhub's boot2root challange, in this case a medium level machine originally created for HackTheBox platform called [Node 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/node-1,252/). One of the things to choose this machine was that this machine could let me improve my knowledge in NodeJS platform, unfortunately this goal only was able to get partially. But, let´s go with the assessment!
### Information Gathering and Penetration Steps
In the port scanning only two services was listening in the host, a SSH service listening in 22/TCP port and a web app in 3000/TCP. I didn´t retrieve any result with the UDP port scanning.

Seemingly this two services didn´t have known vulnerabilities which could be exploitable to gain access on the system, so probably the explotation should be achieved with some application bug. The web application had only two dynamic services, one of them to recover some public information of the three users of it (tom, mark and rastatin) and the login form to access to private zone. First of all I tried unsuccessfully to fuzz the login with dictionary and SQL injection attacks. In the other hand, the variables used in the profile zone didn´t be in client web browser so I was not able to abuse them. Also, I was not able to perform a web directory brute forcing due to a error messages (as will be shown later, server filtered Dirbuster through its specific User-Agent). Checking the web app in deep detail, I was able to see that when I do a request to retrieve information of the user, a request to an API is executed which responses to me with the SHA-256 hash of their passwords:

Cracking the hashes with online services and them using it in the login form didn´t be enough, I only got a message. As it could be shown before, this three users didn´t have admin rights ("is_admin:false") so probably I needed to get an additional user with this privilege. Neither using this pair of user and credentials didn´t work in the SSH panel.
