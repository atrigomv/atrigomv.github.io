title: Playing with Boto3 (python) and AWS
---
One of my current roles is to be a part of the security architecture team, reviewing a lot of architectures and defining our own cloud security framework.
As other companies, one of the most important issues when the IT teams works with cloud architectures here, is the possibility that sensitive data could be storaged and managed in cloud.
In order to prevent this possibility, there are some services within cloud providers catalogue which help us in this task but many times, this services are not deployed in our region or the services doesn´t work fine with spanish words (for example, AWS Macie).
With this scenario, and with the main goal of improve my knowledge in AWS, I´ve developed a very simple [script](https://github.com/atrigomv/aws/blob/master/s3_DLP_PoC.py) that reviews objects storaged in the S3 buckets, and analyzes its content to detect sensitive data (real names, DNI, NIE, plates...etc).
The script is only a proof of concept, it not works perfectly, but it shows the potential in the use of this kind of tools.
