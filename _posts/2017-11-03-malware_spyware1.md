title: Malware Analysys Spyware 1
---
This week I've had to do another malware analysis, again with a phising email as entry vector. Due to in my personal malware analysis lab I don't have Outlook and the malware was attached in a .msg, first of all I had to looking for the way to extract it. To do that, I found the script [msg-extractor](https://github.com/mattgwwalker/msg-extractor) which I was able to use in the Windows machine. The files extracted was two .ace compressed files that had two identical PE Windows executables but with different name.
