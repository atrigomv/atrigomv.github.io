title: Malware Analysys Spyware 1
---
This week I've had to do another malware analysis, again with a phising email as entry vector. Due to in my personal malware analysis lab I don't have Outlook and the malware was attached in a .msg, first of all I had to looking for the way to extract it. To do that, I found the script [msg-extractor](https://github.com/mattgwwalker/msg-extractor) which I was able to use in the Windows machine. The files extracted was two .ace compressed files that had two identical PE Windows executables but with different name. Despite the fact that the analysis was deep, I was not able to know exactly what the malware do but different things could be determined:
1. Both executables are written in Visual Basic 5.0 or Visual Basic 6.0 and no presence of packers that could obfuscate their code is detected (neither by the result thrown by PeID nor judging by the comparison of sizes between the raw size and the virtual size):
