title: Windows penetration test - CHEE
---
### Information Gathering Step

Now it is time to review a Windows Server machine, in this case 2008 version. As it is shown below, this server hasn't web applications running and I only identified two interesting services to be exploited, SMB and RDP:

![evidence1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win1_01.png)

My first attemp was attack RDP service. Cheking it, I only detected a RCE vulnerability ([MS12-020](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2012/ms12-020)) but with a public exploit which only crashes the remote machine. Due to we are in lab environment, I executed the exploit and the DoS attack was performed:

This was cool but isn't allow me to penetrate the machine. Regarding to SMB service, it was version 2 and vulnerabilities such as [MS08-67 "netapi"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/958644/ms08-067-vulnerability-in-server-service-could-allow-remote-code-execu) doesn't affect it.
