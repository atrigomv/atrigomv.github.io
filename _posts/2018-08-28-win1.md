### Information Gathering and Penetration Steps

Now it is time to review a Windows Server machine, in this case 2008 version. As it is shown below, this server hasn't web applications running and I only identified two interesting services to be exploited, SMB and RDP:

My first attempt was attack RDP service. Cheking it, I only detected a RCE vulnerability ([MS12-020](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2012/ms12-020)) but with a public exploit which only crashes the remote machine. Due to we are in lab environment, I executed the exploit and the DoS attack was performed:

This was cool but isn't allow me to penetrate the machine. Regarding to SMB service, it was version 2 and vulnerabilities such as [MS08-67 "netapi"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/958644/ms08-067-vulnerability-in-server-service-could-allow-remote-code-execu) doesn't affect it. The good way was focusing the attack to this service and trying to exploit the [MS09-050](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2009/ms09-050) vulnerability which has a known exploit in Metasploit framework. In the first attempt, I got the penetration into the target machine and I obtained a meterpreter session:

### Privilege Elevation Step

In this machine we had admin rights (we was "nt authority\system") so in this case I had not to analyze any method to elevate. Instead of this, I tried to do additional things specially those things focused on maintenance future access into the host. First off all, with this admin rights, I created a new user within admin group:
